His body was covered with cuts and bruises but Bane hadn’t been able to get any blood on his clothing. None of Bane’s equipment was damaged but the attack had scared him and he did not know what happened next. “You are going to have to show me your hand if I ever see you again!” “Right,” he said and his head rolled forward until his lips were inches from her ear. “Goodnight, my lady.” “Damn you, get your hands off of me
His body was covered with fresh blood. I’d heard a lot of things about the man, but this was the first time I’d seen one of his men so badly beaten and bloodied. “I’d appreciate it if you left us alone. We don’t need anymore of your trouble right now,” said a woman who appeared out of nowhere, right beside me. “I’m not interested in your trouble,” I growled, “I just don’t like you touching my sister,” and

His body was covered with red-hot coals, and his eyes stared with a wild expression. I will admit that I am not much of a coward, but fear took hold of me. I started trembling. Then, I saw him. He was alive! I ran to him, wanting to free him, but he fought me, and I let him fall, and he was trying to get up, and I kicked him in the side. Then I saw him get up, and he was trying to run
His body was covered with blood soaking through his shirt, a trickle of blood running down his left hand. Colin drew the sword back and swung it once again, the sword cutting through the sheets and the man’s back. The sword had been covered with a scarlet stain, just like the man’s shirt. Blood dripped down as he fell forwards, his head falling off once he was on the ground. A war cry sounded from the other side of the room, and Colin recognised it as the
His body was covered with blood. His face was a mess, his eyes swollen shut with pain. His head had fallen back against the wall, and his neck was bent backward to where his head was touching the wall, and blood had soaked through his shirt. His hands were tied behind his back. There were three destructions behind him. ← Could this really be true? A week ago, reviewing a case on the television set, the judge ruled. Before the court a man entered and
His body was covered with a thin layer of ash, having been burnt to a crisp. His clothes were shredded, but his belt was untouched. I didn’t bother looking at his shoes. “Who ordered that?” “He took it upon himself, sir, to ensure that he would be the one to die,” Tegal said. I scanned the room. I never asked him that. “You covered up the body,” I said. “Yes, sir,” Tegal said. “But there
His body was covered with blood spouts and his eyes were wild. His skin was all dry crust, his hair matted with it, and his mouth opened and frothed, his face contorted in terror. He screamed like a wounded animal. “Get the fuck away from me! Get out of my way! Get out of my fucking way! Get the fuck out of my way! Get the fuck out of my way! I’ve had enough, fuck! I’ve had enough. I know
His body was covered with blood up to his ankles, and he was still squirming in the way of death. He was no different from the man he killed. The man who was his son. The man who wanted to kill him. He was no different than any other man he had killed. His eyes were dull with misery, his skin a shade of indigo. He was the color of a dead fish, and his body was a bundle of contorted bones. He was no longer a man,
His body was covered with a thick layer of ash, but it was impossible to tell if it had been some sort of explosion or if he’d been burned alive. Whatever the cause, no one could see him. The man and the woman, both in their late forties, knelt in the snow and hugged. They didn’t know what was happening, but there was nothing they could do to save him. He was a short man, nearly a dwarf. The man was dressed in a long skirt
His body was covered with stains of blood, and the man did not appear to be human. ``I don't know how to tell you this, but those are not people, and there is no reason for those people to be here.

His body was covered with an eerie pale green aura, like the inside of a coffin. The spider-like cephalopods were no longer pursuing him. They were now gathered behind him.

His body was covered with soot, but you could clearly see his facial expression. “I’m sorry,” he said sincerely. “It’s all right. At least I was able to save you guys from the flames. It was your fault. You two should’ve given me aid earlier.” “We did,” the guy replied. “We tried. But you were too heavy on your own. Your charger was dead then. You’re not supposed to fight alone. Especially when you’re
His body was covered with bruises, but, sadly, none of them were life-threatening. Only one of them, his right ankle, was still in the cast from his ruptured tendon, which had been removed immediately after the surgery the day before. But now the pain from the ruptured tendon, the ones that had hit his chest, and his back were gone. It was now a constant niggle in the periphery of his mind, like the faint ticking of a time-
His body was covered with the blood. It left a trail on the tarmac, headed straight towards him, and then stopped dead in his own blood.

His body was covered with wet, wet wounds. But he wasn’t the only one who’d taken them. There was a male dressed in a dark blue costume that appeared to have been dyed purple, a red costume that’d been infused with fire, and a female in a black costume that was like a blacksmith’s outfit with a cloth overlay. The woman had a green visor. package org.apache.hadoop.fs.azure; import com.google.common
His body was covered with a blanket. He lay on his side with one arm raised up his chest, the other hand at his side. They didn’t wait long. The men in the room lifted him up, set him down on the table. He was still covered in his own blood. When he tried to raise his head, they brought a tray and a glass of water, and he let them do what they wanted. Chick pulled out a little knife he’d found in one of the cabinets and cut his
His body was covered with blood. The Governor and his guards surrounded him. “I can’t let you live,” he said, “You betrayed us once, and just like the rest of you, we won’t let you live that way. For me, this is personal. I will not let you live.” He stepped closer to the man. The Governor’s guards held their ground, but they seemed hesitant. The Governor stepped in front of the man and put his hands up to block the sword
His body was covered with cuts and bruises, some of them on his face. The others were on his chest, arms, and legs. He was breathing heavily, but unconsciously. He stared up at me and I could tell he was dying. “Pick up the shotgun, Dane,” I ordered, pointing to the side of the fallen house. “Let’s get him out of the way.

His body was covered with small pinprick-size wounds, all from the same object, a silver-colored ball. “You’re weak! Stop!” he screamed. “Stop hitting me! You’re hurting me!” Beneath the heavy thatch, the blood from the wounds had caked into a puddle, and he sat up, weeping and crawling toward the pool, his efforts stumbling along the stones. He missed the puddle by a few feet, but he
His body was covered with wounds. They’d just need to get a doctor to him. “I’m going to rock you to sleep, okay?” She kissed him and he lifted his arms to take her into his arms.

His body was covered with purple bruises. But I wasn't going to let myself get caught up in the emotion. Besides, I was a professional. I couldn't let my emotions get the better of me. I took a deep breath, then gave a soft smile as I took the syringe from him. It was a tiny speck of what he could have been, just a speck of what he could have been, if only I hadn't been so impatient. "Good boy,"
